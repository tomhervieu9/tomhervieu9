Hey there 😃, my name is Thomas, but I frequently go by Tom.

**Values I hold dear when building:**
- Think on first-principles (breaking things down into their truest nature)
- Plan by working backwards from the perfect UX
- Unique naming is vital for coordination and communication
- Comments communicate intent and context that variable names cannot always convey
- Small amounts add up, tiny amounts don't - optimizations don't always win over legibility and simplicity

**A high-level view of my programming experience:**  
- 2 years data engineering at Georgia Tech (Python, NumPy, Pandas, D3.js)
- 3 years Software Engineer (C#, .NET, SQL, TortoiseSVN)
- 3 years (and counting) Frontend Software Engineer (TypeScript, React, Electron, Node.js, GraphQL, Nx)

** What I am working on now at home:**
- Experimenting with new technologies: Vite, Tailwind, Postgres, Next.js, Tanstack Start/Query, and more!
